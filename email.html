                    If this is a trial subscription, there are no fees until the trial
                    period is over. For all subscribers - so that your subscription stays
                    current - WorldNetDaily will charge your credit card the low
                    prevailing renewal rate at the same interval as when you first
                    subscribed. (i.e. If you chose a monthly subscription, every month on
                    the date of your original purchase, we will charge your card the
                    monthly rate.)<br />
                    <br />
                    This agreement will continue until it is canceled by you, which you
                    may do at any time by submitting a cancellation request in writing
                    via email to <a href="mailto=wbhelp@wnd.com">wbhelp@wnd.com</a>, by
                    phone (1-800-496-3266), or by fax (816-220-2727).<br />
                    <br />
                    Cancellation requests will be processed within 5 business days, and
                    no further charges will be made after that time. No refunds will be
                    provided for charges made prior to, or less than 5 business days
                    after your cancellation request is received.</span><br />
